**Q3)  Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?**
Ans:

P(Two heads and one tail) = No. of Events(Two heads and one tail) / Total No. of Events(three coins tossed)
                               = 3/8  = 0.375  = 37.5%

**Q4)  Two Dice are rolled, find the probability where sum is**

a)  Equal to 1 
b)  Less than or equal to 4 
c)  Divisible by 2 and 3 


Ans: Number of possible outcomes for the above event is
       Number of event(two dice rolled) = 6^2  = 32

       
       a)  P(sum is equal to 1)
       = Number of events/Total number of events
       = 1/36.

       b) P(sum is less than or equal to 4)
       = Number of events/Total number of events
       = 6/36
       = 1/36

       c) P(sum is divisible by 2 and 3)
       = Number of events/Total number of events
       = 5/36

**Q5) Abag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls.  Two balls are drawn at random.  What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?**

Ans:  There are of total 7 balls including a blue ball. We need to exclude a blue    ball so that we have 5 balls and 2 blue balls so we can consider it as  


a) Probability of drawing the first ball that is not blue:
P (non-blue on first draw) = number of non-blue balls / total number of balls           
                           = 2(red balls) + 3(green) /7
                           = 5/7

                           
b) Probability of drawing the second ball that is not blue after the first draw:
Non blue ball (2 red + 2 green)
P (non- blue ball on second draw/ non-blue on first draw)
                           = number of remaining non-blue balls/total number of 
                             remaining balls    
                           = 4/6
                           = 2/3

                           
c) Probability of both events happening together:
P (both draws are non-blue) = P (non-blue on first draw) × P (non-blue on second draw /non-blue on first draw)
                            = 5/7 × 2/3
                            = 10/21
Therefore, the probability that none of balls drawn is 10/21. 


**Q6)  Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child:
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)**

CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120

Child A - probability of having 1 candy = 0.015
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20


    Ans: The expected number of candies for a randomly selected child is 3.315
    Explanation:  The formula for calculating the expected value(mean) is given by:
          E(X) = Ei (Xi*Pi)
          E(X) = (1*0.015) + (4*0.20) + (3*0.65) + (5*0.0005) + (6*0.01) + (2*0.120)
                   = 0.015 + 0.80 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24  
          E(X) = 3.09

**Q8)  Calculate Expected Value for the problem below**
     **a)	The weights (X) of patients at a clinic (in pounds), are
108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199
Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient?**

Ans:  Expected Value is also known as mean or average.

Formula of Mean 
 E(X) = ∑(Xi)/n
 E(X) = 108 + 110 + 123 + 134 + 135 + 145 + 167 + 187 + 199/9
      = 1308/9
 E(X) = 145.33
 So, the expected value of the weight of a randomly choosen patient is approximately 145.33 pounds.

Ans:
   The above histogram is right skewed histogram , also known as postivily skewed or right tail of the distribution when compared to the left side.  In other words we can say that themajority of data points are concentrated on the left side, and there are fewer data points on the right side creating a tail that will extends to the right.
•	The mean is typically greater than the median.
•	The majority of data points are clustered on the left side of the histogram.
      Boxplot:
              Here, the box plotshows the outliers in upperbound.  It means that identifying data points that are significantly higher than the majority of the dataset.


Q11) Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?
  
   
   Ans:  To calculate the confidence intervals for the average weight of adult males in Mexico, 
                         Confidence Interval (CI) =       ˉx ± (Zσ/√n)
        Where,
          x (sample mean) = 20
         σ (standard deviation) = 30
         n (sample size) = 2000
         Z = Z-score 
The Z-score for 94%, 96% and confidence level are approximately 1.88, 1.96 and 2.33 respectively.
    Let’s calculate the confidence intervals:
1.	94% Confidence interval:
Margin of Error = 1.88 × 30/√2000
                = 1.261
Confidence Interval = 200 - 1.261
                    = 198.739
Confidence Interval = 200 + 1.261
                    = 201.261
 
 
2.	 96% Confidence Interval:
Margin of Error = 1.96 × 30/√2000
                = 1.314
Confidence Interval = 200 - 1.314
                    = 198.621
Confidence Interval = 200 + 1.314
                    = 201.378
 


3.	98% Confidence Interval:
Margin of Error = 2.33 × 30/√2000
                = 1.563
Confidence Interval = 200 - 1.563
                    = 198.437
Confidence Interval = 200 + 1.563
                    = 201.563
 
Therefore, the estimated average weight of adult meals in Mexico with 94%, 96%, and 98% confidence are (198.739 - 201.261), (198.686 - 201.314) and (198.437 - 201.563) respectively.


**Q12) Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests**
**34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56**
**1)	Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
2)	What can we say about the student marks?**


Ans:  I) Let’s calculate the mean, median, variance and standard deviation for the set of scores:
 Scores: 34, 36, 36, 38, 38, 39, 39, 40, 40, 41, 41, 41, 41, 42, 42, 45, 49, 56
i) Mean (Average):
      Mean = ∑(xi)/N                                                
           = 34+36+36+38+38+39+39+40+40+41+41+41+41+42+42+45+49+56
           = 738/18
           = 41

           
ii)	Median:
Generally Median is the middle value.  If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two values.
 Median = 40.5
 

iii)	Variance:
Variance = ∑(xi-x)2/N
         = (34-41)2+(36-41)2+(36-41)2+(38-41)2+(38-41)2+(39-41)2+(39-41)2
                          +(40-41)2+(40)2+(41-41)2+(41-41)2+(41-41)2+(41-41)2
                          +(42-41)2+(42-41)2+(45-41)2+(49-41)2+(56-41)2/18
         = 14+ 25+ 25+ 9+ 9+ 4+ 4+ 1+ 1+ 0+ 0+ 0+ 0+1+ 1+16+ 64+ 225/18
         = 474/18
  Variance = 26.33
 

iv)	Standard Deviation:
Standard Deviation=√Variance
                  = √26.33
                  = 5.13
 


Therefore, let’s interpret the results:
 Mean: The average score is 41.
 Median: The median score is 40.5.
 Variance: The variance score is 26.33
 Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is 5.13
         
    II) Interpretation:
i)	The mean and median are close, suggesting that the data is not heavily skewed.
ii)	The variance and standard deviation indicate the spread or dispersion of the scores.  A higher standard deviation implies more variability in the scores.
iii)	Mean is greater than median.


**Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data are equal?**


   Ans:  When the mean and median of a dataset are equal, it indicates that the distribution is approximately symmetric.   In a symmetric distribution, the data is evenly distributed on both sides of the center, and there is a balance between the left tails and the right tails.
              Mean=Median then it is a perfectly symmetric distribution, the skewness is Zero.


**Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median?**
    Ans:   When mean is greater than median in a distribution, it indicates that the distribution is positively skewed.  Positive skewness means that the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the left side, and the majority of the data points are concentrated on the left side.
        **The nature of positively skewness distribution:**
•	The mean is pulled to the right by the presence of relatively larger values in the right tail.
•	The median is generally closer to the left because it is less affected by extreme values.  


**Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?**
      Ans:  When the median is greater than the mean in a distribution, it indicates that the distribution is negatively skewed.  Negative skewness means that the tail on the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right side, and the majority of the data points are concentrated on the right side.
   **The nature of negatively skewed distribution:**
•	The mean is pulled to the left by the presence of relatively smaller values in the left tail.
•	The median is generally closer to the right because it is less affected by extreme values.



**Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?**
            Ans: A positive kurtosis value indicates that a dataset has heavy tails and a relatively pronounced peak near the mean, compared to a normal distribution.  Kurtosis measures the “tailedness” of a probability distribution, reflecting whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.
        Positive kurtosis indicates leptokurtosis, meaning that the tails of the distribution are fatter than those of a normal distribution.  In a leptokurtic distribution:
•	The data have more extreme value (outlines) than would be expected in a normal distribution.
•	The distribution has a more peaked or taller central region compared to a normal distribution.
        Positive kurtosis (greater than 0): Indicates leptokurtosis, heavy tails, and a pronounced peak.  


**Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?**

Ans:  A negative kurtosis value indicates that a dataset has lighter tails and a flatter peak compared to a normal distribution.  Kurtosis measures the “tailedness” of a probability distribution and reflects whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.
        Negative kurtosis indicates platykurtosis. 
•	The tails of the distribution are less extreme the those of a normal distribution.
•	The central peak is flatter or shorter compared to a normal distribution.
        Negative kurtosis (less than 0):  Indicates lighter tails, and a flatter peak.

**What can we say about the distribution of the data?**


Ans:  The data is skewed towards left. 
      The whisker range of minimum value is greater than the maximum 

**What will be the IQR of the data (approximately)?**
   Ans:  The Inter Quantile Range (IQR) = Q3(upper quartile) – Q1(lower quartile)
                                        = 18 – 10

•	Population mean (µ) = 270 days
•	Sample mean(ˉxˉ) = 260 days
•	Sample standard deviation(s) = 90 days
•	Sample size(n) = 18 bulbs

  Hence, t_score = -0.471
  stats.t.cdf ( -0.471, 17) = 0.32 =32%
